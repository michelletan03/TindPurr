# TindPurr
Inspired by Tinder but this website is for cats! The catch? It's a cat adoption site that looks like a dating app. This helps the shelters, fosters, and potential owners to adopt instead of buying cats. Helps to raise awareness for "adopt don't shop". Find the love of your cat now. 

Why did I thought about cat adoption site? Reason is, I found the cat of my life through adoption her name is Renge and she has been inspiring me and makes my life colorful everyday. You can see her too in the website.
